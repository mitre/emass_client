# eMASS Client
The eMASS client repository (```emass_client```) maintains the Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service (eMASS) Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) specifications and executables. The executables packages currently provided are: RubyGem and TypeScript Node.

***NOTE***: A CLI tool called [emasser](https://github.com/mitre/emasser), has been developed that makes use of the ```emass_client``` RubyGem.

## [eMASS API Specification](https://mitre.github.io/emass_client/docs/redoc/)
The eMASS API is documented in YAML and can be viewed utilizing a multitude of visualization tools. Included is a dependency-free (and nice looking) rendering tool for viewing the API specification. The documentation is automatically generated using a Continuos Integration (CI) action [redoc-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redoc-cli) command line tool.


## [Visualize and Interact with eMASS API](https://mitre.github.io/emass_client/docs/renderer/)
This repository allows anyone to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place, via [hosted](https://mitre.stoplight.io/docs/emasser/c48309f365cf1-enterprise-mission-assurance-support-service-e-mass) or local mock servers. Please reference [Developers Instruction](docs/developers.md) on how to setup a local mock server

## eMASS API Clients Generation Process
The executable packages (APIs) generated are used to access eMASS data and functionality by external third-party developers, business partners, or internal departments.

The following ```emass_client``` executable packages are generated by this repository:
- Ruby - The ruby package is hosted and available in the [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/emass_client). 

- Typescript - The typescript package is hosted and available in the [NpmRegistry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mitre/emass_client).

### Making Changes to eMASS Clients
The most appropriat way to propose modifications or make changes to the eMASS clients generated in this repository is by [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) this repository. 

- Step 1

  [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) this repository 
 
- Step 2 (otional)

  Create a new [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#branch) to apply the modifications 
  
- Step 3

  [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the newly create branch into the local machine

- Step 4

  Make the necessary changes, modification locally
  
  Ensure that the client(s) configuration file ```src/openapi/templates/[ruby or typescript]-generator-config.json``` reflect the correct version to be generated
  
  **Note**: Modifications or updates to the eMASS API specification file ```eMASSRestOpenApi.yaml``` triggers the clients' generation actions; both the ruby ```src/ruby_client```and typescript-axios ```src/typescript_client```clients are re-generated and committed to the repository when [merged](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request) with the main branch.
  
- Step 5

  [Update](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) local changes to the forked 
  
- Step 6

  Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), this is where the changes are compared to the main branch of the forked repository

- Step 7

  Once the repository maintainer has approved a pull request, the updates in the forked or branch repository are merged with the main project repository.
  

***NOTE***: The generated clients version does not necessary have to be synchronized with the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/mitre/emass_client/releases)


### Other Programming Languages
For detail information on how-to generating eMASS clients for other programming languages reference [**Developers Instructions**](docs/developers.md)


## Repository Architecture
The process provided by this repository is depicted by the architecture diagram below. In a nutshell, it provides the capability of hosting the eMAASS API documentation, generating interactive visualization tools, static/dynamic testing, and generating API clients for ```ruby``` and ```typescript``` languages.

### Client Application
The ``emass_client`` executable packages can be included in other projects, or used to generate  CLI tools that have a need to access an eMASS instance. This is demonstrated by the diagram below.
