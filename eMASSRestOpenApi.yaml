  description: |
      The Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service (eMASS) Representational State
      Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) enables users to perform
      assessments and complete actions associated with system records. 
      
      <strong>Register External Application (that use the eMASS API)</strong></br>
      New users will need to [register](https://nisp.emass.apps.mil/Content/Help/jobaids/eMASS_OT_NewUser_Job_Aid.pdf)
      an API key with the eMASS development team prior to accessing the site for the first time. The eMASS REST API 
      requires a client certificate (SSL/TLS, DoD PKI only). Use the `Registration` endpoint to register the client
      certificate.</br></br>
      
      Every call to the eMASS REST API will require the use of the agreed upon public key certificate and API key. 
      The API key must be provided in the request header for all endpoint calls (api-key). If the service receives
      an untrusted certificate or API key, a 401 error response code will be returned along with an error message.</br></br>
  
      <strong>Available Request Headers</strong></br>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th align=left>key</th>
          <th align=left>Example Value</th>
          <th align=left>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>`api-key`</td>
          <td>api-key-provided-by-emass</td>
          <td>This API key must be provided in the request header for all endpoint calls</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>`user-uid`</td>
          <td>USER.UID.KEY</td>
          <td>This User unique identifier key must be provided in the request header for all PUT, POST, and DELETE endpoint calls</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td></td><td></td>
          <td>
            Note: For DoD users this is the DoD ID Number (EIDIPI) on their DoD CAC
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      </br><strong>Approve API Client for Actionable Requests</strong></br>
      Users are required to log-in to eMASS and grant permissions for a client to update data
      within eMASS on their behalf. This is only required for actionable requests (PUT, POST,
      DELETE). The Registration Endpoint and all GET requests can be accessed without completing
      this process with the correct permissions. Please note that leaving a field parameter blank
      (for PUT/POST requests) has the potential to clear information in the active eMASS records.

      To establish an account with eMASS and/or acquire an api-key/user-uid, contact one of the listed POC:

tags:
  - name: Test
    description: >
      The Test Connection endpoint provides the ability to verify connection to the web service.
  - name: Registration
    description: >
      The Registration endpoint provides the ability to register a certificate & obtain an API-key.
  - name: Systems
    description: |
      The Systems endpoints provide the ability to view system information.

      **Notes**
        - If a system is dual-policy enabled, the returned system details default to the RMF policy information unless otherwise specified for an individual system.
        - Certain fields are instance specific and may not be returned in GET request.
  - name: System Roles
    description: |
      The System Roles endpoints provides the ability to access user data assigned to systems.

      **Notes:**
      - The endpoint can access three different role categories: PAC, CAC, and Other.
      - If a system is dual-policy enabled, the returned system role information will default to the RMF policy information unless otherwise specified.
  - name: Controls
    description: "The Controls endpoints provide the ability to view, add, and update
      Security Control information to a system for both the Implementation Plan and
      Risk Assessment."
  - name: Test Results
    description: >
      The Test Results endpoints provide the ability to view and add test results for a system's
      Assessment Procedures (CCIs) which determine Security Control compliance.
  - name: POAM

      **Notes:**
      - POST requests will only yield successful results if the Security Control is at the
        first stage of the CAC. If the control is not at the first stage, an error will be returned.      
  - name: PAC
    description: |
      The Package Approval Chain (PAC) endpoints provide the ability to view the status of
      existing workflows and initiate new workflows for a system.

      - If the indicated system has any active workflows, the response will include information
        such as the workflow type and the current stage of each workflow.
      - If there are no active workflows, then a null data member will be returned.

          <strong>Information</strong><br>
          The request body of a POST request through the Artifact Endpoint accepts a single binary file
          with file extension ".zip" only. This accepted .zip file should contain one or more files
          corresponding to existing artifacts or new artifacts that will be created upon successful receipt.
          Filename uniqueness throughout eMASS will be enforced by the API.<br><br>
          Upon successful receipt of a file, if a file within the .zip is matched via filename to an artifact
          existing within the application, the file associated with the artifact will be updated. If no artifact
          is matched via filename to the application, a new artifact will be created with the following
          default values. Any values not specified below will be blank.
          <ul>
            <li>isTemplate: false</li>
            <li>type: other</li>
            <li>category: evidence</li>
          </ul>
          To update values other than the file itself, please submit a PUT request.<br>
          
          <strong>Zip file information</strong><br>
          Upload a zip file contain one or more files corresponding to existing artifacts
          or new artifacts that will be created upon successful receipt.<br><br>

          Artifact version cannot be saved if an Artifact with the same file name already exist in the system.

          Artifact cannot be saved if the file size exceeds 30MB.
