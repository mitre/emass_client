  description: |
      The Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service (eMASS) Representational State
      Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) enables users to perform
      assessments and complete actions associated with system records. 
      
      <strong>Register External Application (that use the eMASS API)</strong></br>
      New users will need to [register](https://nisp.emass.apps.mil/Content/Help/jobaids/eMASS_OT_NewUser_Job_Aid.pdf)
      an API key with the eMASS development team prior to accessing the site for the first time. The eMASS REST API 
      requires a client certificate (SSL/TLS, DoD PKI only). Use the `Registration` POST endpoint to register the client
      certificate. CHANGE 1</br></br>
      
      Every call to the eMASS REST API will require the use of the agreed upon public key certificate and API key. 
      The API key must be provided in the request header for all endpoint calls (api-key). If the service receives
      an untrusted certificate or API key, a 401 error response code will be returned along with an error message.</br></br>
  
      <strong>Available Request Headers</strong></br>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th align=left>key</th>
          <th align=left>Example Value</th>
          <th align=left>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>`api-key`</td>
          <td>api-key-provided-by-emass</td>
          <td>This API key must be provided in the request header for all endpoint calls</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>`user-uid`</td>
          <td>USER.UID.KEY</td>
          <td>This User unique identifier key must be provided in the request header for all PUT, POST, and DELETE endpoint calls</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td></td><td></td>
          <td>
            Note: For DoD users this is the DoD ID Number (EIDIPI) on their DoD CAC
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      </br><strong>Approve API Client for Actionable Requests</strong></br>
      Users are required to log-in to eMASS and grant permissions for a client to update data
      within eMASS on their behalf. This is only required for actionable requests (PUT, POST,
      DELETE). The Registration Endpoint and all GET requests can be accessed without completing
      this process with the correct permissions. Please note that leaving a field parameter blank
      (for PUT/POST requests) has the potential to clear information in the active eMASS records.

      To establish an account with eMASS and/or acquire an api-key/user-uid, contact one of the listed POC:

        **Notes**
        - If a POC email is supplied, the application will attempt to locate a user already
          registered within the application and pre-populate any information not explicitly supplied
          in the request. If no such user is found, these fields are **required** within the request.<br>
          `pocOrganization`, `pocFirstName`, `pocLastName`, `pocEmail`, `pocPhoneNumber`<br />

        - To prevent uploading duplicate/undesired milestones through the POA&M PUT we must include an `isActive` field for the milestone and set it to equal to false `(isActive=false)`.

          <strong>Information</strong><br>
          The body of a request through the Artifacts POST endpoint accepts a single binary file. Two 
          Artifact POST methods are currently accepted: individual and bulk. Filename uniqueness within 
          an eMASS system will be enforced by the API for both methods.
          <br><br>
          For POST requests that should result in a single artifact, the request should include the file.
          <br><br>
          For POST requests that should result in the creation of many artifacts, the request should include 
          a single file with the extension ".zip" only and the parameter isBulk should be set to true. This 
          .zip file should contain one or more files corresponding to existing artifacts or new artifacts that 
          will be created upon successful receipt.
          <br><br>
          Upon successful receipt of one or many artifacts, if a file is matched via filename to an artifact 
          existing within the application, the file associated with the artifact will be updated. If no artifact 
          is matched via filename to the application, a new artifact will be created with the following 
          default values. Any values not specified below will be null
          <ul>
            <li>isTemplate: false</li>
            <li>type: Other</li>
            <li>category: Evidence</li>
          </ul>
          To update values other than the file itself, please submit a PUT request.<br>
          
          <strong>Business Rules</strong><br>
          Artifact cannot be saved if the fields below exceed the following character limits:
          <ul>
            <li>Filename - 1,000 characters</li>
            <li>Name - 100 characters</li>
            <li>Description - 10,000 characters</li>
            <li>Reference Page Number - 50 characters</li>
          </ul>
          Artifact cannot be saved if the file does not have an allowable file extension/type:

              .docx,.doc,.txt,.rtf,.xfdl,.xml,.mht,.mh,tml,.html,.htm,.pdf,.mdb,.accdb,.ppt,
              .pptx,.xls,.xlsx,.csv,.log,.jpeg,.jpg,.tiff,.bmp,.tif,.png,.gif,.zip,.rar,.msg,
              .vsd,.vsw,.vdx,.z{#},.ckl,.avi,.vsdx

          Artifact version cannot be saved if an Artifact with the same file name (filename) already exist in the system.

          Artifact cannot be saved if the file size exceeds 30MB.

          Artifact cannot be saved if the following fields are missing data:
          <ul>
            <li>Filename (filename)</li>
            <li>Type (type)</li>
            <li>Category (category)</li>
          </ul>

          Artifact cannot be saved if the Last Review Date (`lastReviewedDate`) is set in the future.

        **Request Body Required Fields**
        - `filename`

        - `type`
        - `category`

        <strong>Information</strong><br>
        The PUT request will replace all existing data with the field/value combinations included in the request body. 
        
        If any fields are not included, the absent fields will become null. 
          
        The fields `name` and `isTemplate` are non-nullable fields. If not specified in the PUT command
        they will default to the following:
          - `name=filename`
          - `isTemplate=false`
          
        Also, note that one-to-many fields (`controls` and `ccis`) will also be replaced with the values specified in the PUT.

        If existing `control or cci` mappings exist in eMASS, the values in the PUT will not append, but 
        rather replace all existing control and cci mappings with the values in the request body.
